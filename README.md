# Vincent Le's Personal Website
This is a personal website built using the Hack4Impact Starter Pack!
My name is **Vincent Le!** As of writing this, I'm a first year **Computer Engineering** major at **Cal Poly San Luis Obispo**. For the past two summers, I was **interning** at an **Information Technology Managed Service Provider** company in **San Jose, CA**. I have learned a lot about information technology, especially with computer repairs, blue screen of death repairs, executive security software like Hornet and Altaro, and lots of database migration. I hope to gain more experiences in the future as I pursue my technical career and CPE major!
